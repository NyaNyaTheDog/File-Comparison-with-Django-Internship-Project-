This is the first project I work using Django. Originally, I run this program in Windows Server 2012 R2 and connect it to the corporate network, so people in different departments (accounting, billing, payments, etc) can use it. As long as that machine is in the network, it can access this program by going through the web browser and tap in to the server.
